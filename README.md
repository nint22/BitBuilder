+ Gameplay:
  + Make formal goal: generate as much data as we currently do today, and then some more (Game ends when Singularity is reached)
  + Formalize generators: list of computing / memory hardware, components, or concepts
  + Allow save / reset
+ InfoFacts: (List of frames / animations to show as the game progresses)
  + Discuss mechanical computers, electro-mechanical, analog, digital, quantum, and biological
  + Discuss Turing / Turing-Machine facts (about computational complexity)
  + Discuss real-world memory examples (a floppy can hold ~ 1 MP3 song, while a DVD is ~ 1 movie, etc.)
  + Discuss Apollo program navigation computer (electro-mechanical)
  + Famous Computer Scientists: (Turing, Church, Knuth, etc.)
  + Discuss Knuth up-arrow notation for huge numbers
  + Conway's Game of Life
